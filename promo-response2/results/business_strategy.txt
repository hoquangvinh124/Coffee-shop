IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
======================

Phase 1: Pilot Test (Week 1-2)
- Test optimal threshold (0.85) on small subset (10% of target)
- Monitor conversion rates and ROI
- Adjust threshold if needed based on actual results

Phase 2: Segment-Based Campaigns (Week 3-4)
- Launch separate campaigns for Hot/Warm/Cold leads
- Customize messaging and offers per segment
- Track performance by segment

Phase 3: Feature-Based Targeting (Week 5-6)
- Implement top 5 targeting strategies
- Personalize offers based on customer features
- A/B test different offer types

Phase 4: Scale & Optimize (Week 7+)
- Roll out to full customer base
- Continuous monitoring and optimization
- Retrain model quarterly with new data

KEY SUCCESS METRICS
===================
1. Conversion Rate: Target 37.50%
2. ROI: Target 2.83x or higher
3. Customer Lifetime Value: Track increase post-campaign
4. Repeat Purchase Rate: Measure long-term impact
5. Campaign Efficiency: Cost per conversion

RISK MITIGATION
================
1. Over-targeting: Limit campaigns to max 2 per customer/month
2. Discount fatigue: Rotate offer types (BOGO, discount, free item)
3. Channel saturation: Multi-channel approach (SMS, email, app, in-store)
4. Model drift: Monitor performance monthly, retrain quarterly

NEXT ACTIONS
============
☐ Present strategy to management for approval
☐ Set up campaign infrastructure (SMS/email/app notifications)
☐ Prepare creative assets for each customer segment
☐ Configure tracking and analytics dashboard
☐ Launch pilot test with Hot Lead segment
