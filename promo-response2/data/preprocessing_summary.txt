PREPROCESSING PIPELINE SUMMARY
==============================

INPUT DATA:
  - Total records: 64,000
  - Original features: 36
  - Target: conversion (binary)
  - Class imbalance: 5.81:1

FEATURE SELECTION:
  - Features dropped: 4 (high cardinality)
  - Features selected: 31
  - Numerical features: 28
  - Categorical features: 3

ENCODING:
  - Label encoding applied to categorical features
  - Encoders saved for production use

TRAIN/TEST SPLIT:
  - Train: 51,200 records (80%)
  - Test: 12,800 records (20%)
  - Stratified split (maintains class distribution)

SCALING:
  - StandardScaler applied to all features
  - Fit on train, transform on test
  - Scaler saved for production use

CLASS BALANCING (SMOTE):
  - Applied to training set only
  - Original train size: 51,200
  - Balanced train size: 87,370
  - New synthetic samples: 36,170
  - Final ratio: 1:1 (perfect balance)

OUTPUT FILES:
  ✓ X_train_balanced.csv - Training features (SMOTE applied)
  ✓ y_train_balanced.csv - Training labels (balanced)
  ✓ X_train_original.csv - Training features (original)
  ✓ y_train_original.csv - Training labels (original)
  ✓ X_test.csv - Test features
  ✓ y_test.csv - Test labels
  ✓ label_encoders.pkl - Categorical encoders
  ✓ scaler.pkl - Feature scaler
  ✓ feature_names.pkl - Feature list

READY FOR MODELING:
  - Features: 31
  - Train samples: 87,370 (balanced)
  - Test samples: 12,800
  - All preprocessing artifacts saved

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Run 04_model_training.py to train ML models
  2. Compare balanced vs unbalanced training
  3. Evaluate on holdout test set
  4. Select best model for deployment
